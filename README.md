# Tensile Test Simulation (Python)

This repository contains a simple Python-based simulation of a uniaxial tensile test.
The goal of this project is **learning**, not high-fidelity accuracy.

It is intended for materials science and engineering students (or anyone interested) to understand how stress–strain behavior can be modeled using basic physics and Python.

---

## Basic Theory -

- Engineering stress, σ = F / A₀

- Engineering strain, ε = ΔL / L₀

- Hooke’s Law (elastic region), σ = E · ε

- Plastic deformation (simplified linear hardening)

---

## How to Run - 

1. Clone the repository - ``` git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tensile-Test-Simulation.git ```
2. Install dependencies - ``` pip install numpy matplotlib ```
3. Run the simulation - ``` python tensile_test.py ```

---

## Output - 

Stress–strain curve
